Personal website for showing off projects, what I am working on. Written with vanilla JSS, HTML, CSS

---

This site is just HTML, CSS and JS, stitched together with Jekyll, and deployed on github pages.

## Features / Improvements to Add

- Fix/Alter background animation (can cause some strain). Potentially add a pause button?
- Improve metadata reading so website more likely to popup. Probably need to refactor blog data / standard-blog layout so I can add more detailed meta-descriptions.
- Create an email subscription system signup component and use a email subscription system so readers can get emails when there's a new blog post :)
