            <p>For my first software development project, I created a command-line program to read bank statement files
                downloaded from online banking sites. The program parsed the data, stored it in an <strong>SQLite</strong> database, and
                exported it into a formatted Excel file.</p>
            <p>This project was the first time I interacted with any build tools (I used <strong>maven</strong> for that
                project), handled proper <strong>logging systems</strong> (log4j here), and <strong>designed a schema.</strong></p>
            <p>I tried to do everything the "right" way. If you look at the code - it is all neatly formatted, javadoc
                comments are present for every function and there's high test coverage. I focused really hard on making
                the
                design extensible,
                ... trying my best to future proof, by following the <strong>SOLID principles</strong>. But, looking back now, it's clear
                I
                was overly fixated on this "perfect" modular idea. The project is over designed, the codebase is
                fragmented with a multitude of small, specialised classes each with only one responsibility.
                It makes it hard to follow </p>
            <p>With regards to the output from the program itself - it does work - but I never use it... mostly because
                of the simple design flaw that I would need to actually login online to download my bank statements. I
                could be bothered enough to build a whole parser, but not to log into my online bank.
            </p>
            <p>Still, I'm happy with this project - it got me started at least :) .</p>

            <p>I developed a basic <strong>2D game using Java (JPanel for Graphics)</strong>. The game loop engine was built from
                scratch, but takes inspiration from various online tutorials.</p>
            <p>In the game, the player controls a square character and a cursor, which cannot pass through walls,
                requiring multitasking to survive. </p>
            <p>Most of the work focused on designing the engine architecture: representing entities and levels,
                implementing a game loop with different “game states,” and managing background tasks like scoring,
                sounds, and events. I used a tile-based level system and a <strong>spatial hash map to optimize collision
                detection and pathfinding</strong>.</p>
            <p>While the game is playable, it is far from polished. The main achievement was understanding how to
                structure a game engine, link its components, and handle real-time updates—experience that has informed
                my later projects and deepened my appreciation for professional game development. </p>
