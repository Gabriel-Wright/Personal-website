        <p>I started developing a web app as a learning activity back in February 2024. Using <strong>Spring
            Boot</strong> for the backend and <a href="https://vaadin.com/" target=_blank>Vaadin</a> for the frontend, I aimed to create a scalable web application
            that I could easily update and maintain. This web app project was a step up from
            simple java command line, single service projects I had made before, my first full stack application with a
            database.</p>

            alt="Old web app schema">
        <p> I used Spring Boot’s integration with <strong>Spring JPA</strong> to model web page data as Java entities, storing them in a
            <strong>MySQL</strong> database. The stored data was then loaded into an article template defined with Vaadin components. At
            the time, I didn't think about using standard text parsing formats like Markdown, so I created a simple
            custom
            markup language to define article content. In retrospect, it's quite cool I went out of my way to make a
            parser--but today, I’d just use Markdown (as I do
            for the blogs on this site).

        <p> I designed a <strong>REST API</strong> to allow programmatic addition of articles and other resources. Using <strong>Spring Security</strong>,
            I added multiple authentication filters, including form-based and token-based authentication. Upload
            endpoints required valid <strong>JWT tokens</strong> for access.</p>

            This was my first time working on a project with multiple layers technologies, and working with web
            technologies.
            My lack of knowledge of on web tech stacks meant I used unorthodox tools (like Vaadin instead of a JS
            framework) and went out of
            my way to develop features that could've been easily streamlined(making a parser instead of markdown).
            I am proud that I managed to deploy the web app and make it publicly available. The issue with
            using a full stack web app for your own website though, is that there's always rooms for extra services to
            make it more efficient.
            Despite separating out layers - I still stored files and images within my Github Repo - obviously not
            ideal/realistic for a production app.
            And while I can update the site using my API - I actually ended up manually deploy the app each time I
            wanted
            to update it.
            There's security issues in the code too - hardcoded my JWT, as well as other sensitive urls, keys and
            passwords in the code.
            But I'd say for my first go - I am pleased at what I achieved. Academically - I wasn't taught about any of
            this, and I sought out the resources myself.
            I was understanding now that the best way to learn with engineering is to just start building.
